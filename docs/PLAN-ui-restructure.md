# Plan: UI Brainstorm Restructure

This plan outlines the restructuring of the Orama UI/UX brainstorming session to incorporate specific design phases and advanced "Vision Pro" aesthetic implementations.

## Overview

The goal is to move from high-level options into a structured implementation roadmap (Phase 4) while refining Options A (Spatial) and B (Active Glass) using expert design intelligence.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] UI Brainstorm includes refined Option A and Option B sections.
- [ ] UI Brainstorm includes a dedicated "Phase 4: Implementation Roadmap" section.
- [ ] Content is enriched with design tokens and UX best practices from UI/UX Pro Max.

## Tech Stack

- **Design:** CSS-first tailwind patterns, Vision Pro design language.
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router).

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Analysis & Research (PLANNING)

- [x] Analyze current `ui-brainstorm.md` content.
- [x] Search UI/UX Pro Max for "Vision Pro", "Glassmorphism", and "Active interaction" patterns.
- [x] Identify key design tokens for Option A and B.

### Phase 2: Content Restructuring (EXECUTION)

- [/] Rewrite Option A (Spatial Depth) with specific technical depth (Z-index, transform-style).
- [/] Rewrite Option B (Active Glass) with interaction patterns (hover glows, backdrop-blur tokens).
- [/] Formulate Phase 4: The implementation sequence for the "Active Glass" transition.

### Phase 3: Final Review (VERIFICATION)

- [ ] Verify that the artifact remains concise yet technically rich.
- [ ] Check links and formatting.

## Phase X: Verification Checklist

- [ ] All required sections (A, B, Phase 4) present.
- [ ] Tone matches "Premium Tech Tutoring".
- [ ] Formatting uses standard Orama artifact conventions.
