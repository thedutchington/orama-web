#### *Orama is an informal, student-run tutoring service that is not a club, company, or official organization, but operates in alignment with Beaumont Unified School District and Beaumont High School policies. If Orama ever transitions to a paid model, any payments will go directly to individual tutors and not to Orama as an entity. Orama does not function as a nonprofit corporation or registered organization of any kind.*
