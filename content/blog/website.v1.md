# What’s Changing

We’re moving beyond Canva and transitioning to a **fully code-driven website** built with **Google Antigravity**, similar to how **Cassini** is developed. This shift allows us to introduce advanced animations, deeper interactivity, and a more refined experience overall.

This update is a core part of the **2026–2027 Orama rebrand**, focused on performance, flexibility, and long-term scalability.

# What’s New

## Added Capabilities

- Smooth, high-performance **animations**
- Rich **interactive elements**
- Fully **responsive design** across devices
- **Google Antigravity** as our development framework (technology, not a user-facing feature)

These changes give us far more creative and technical control than template-based tools ever could.

# What’s Coming Next

## Conversational AI

We plan to introduce **Cassini-powered conversational AI**, available in both cloud-based and local configurations. This AI will be designed to:

- Answer student questions
- Assist with learning and problem-solving
- Provide contextual academic support

A **Google Gemini integration** is being explored as a potential enhancement.

## Membership Tiers & Founders Club

Founders Club has **not** been removed.

Those who joined on day one or were part of **Founders Club in 2025** will retain their tier as a **legacy status**, officially named:

**Founders Club Legacy**

This tier will remain exclusive, while **new tiers** are introduced in the future.
