# What Is Changed?

Instead of using Canva, we will be using coding to create the website, with Google Antigravity, like Cassini. This allows us to add animations, and make the website more interactive. This is apart of our 2026-2027 Orama rebrand.

# What Is Added?

## New Features

- Animations
- Interactive Elements
